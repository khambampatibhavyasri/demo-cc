# Since we're using MongoDB Atlas, we don't need a MongoDB deployment
# This file is kept for reference but won't be applied in production
#
# MongoDB Atlas provides:
# - Managed database service
# - Automatic scaling
# - Built-in security
# - Monitoring and alerting
# - Automated backups
#
# Connection is handled via the MONGODB_URI secret in backend-secret.yaml
